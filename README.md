# Maxs-Projects
Stuff I've done (Java):

TETRIS
- Built on a Location class from the AP CS Committee.

SOLITAIRE
- Another AP CS-related project.

CHESS
- One final AP CS-related project.

FINDAUTHOR
- This project uses statistics/word styles/word frequencies to predict which authors wrote which texts. 
- The uploaded project does not have a set of texts to test but texts can be added as .txt files.

GDF-11 PROJECT
- Only my first algorithm for finding significant identical gene sequences is uploaded here. Other algorithms are not 100% mine and thus private.
